Welcome to the Programming with Python Data Structures Tutorial. Every Python programmer needs to understand these topics:

- [Linked-Lists](2-linked_lists.md)
- [Trees](3-trees.md)

Each module answers questions surrounding the topic including some examples. At the end of each module, there will be a problem to solve on your own. Only look at the solution once you have attempted to solve the problem first.
