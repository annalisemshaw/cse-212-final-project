# Linked Lists

In this module, you will be introduced to the basic concepts of linked lists and will be followed with a quick coding challenge.

FYI: This is one of my favorite data structure topics so let's jump right in! >.<

## What is a Linked List?
A linked list is a sequence of elements, more often referred to as nodes, that are connected via links. Each node has a value and a bi-directional connection which acts as a pointer to previous and next node. The link points to a location in memory that contains the previous or next element/node. The firrst node in a linked list is know as the head and the last node is called the tail. If there is only one node in a list, it is both the head and tail.

## Inserting into a linked list
What I enjoy most about linked lists is how you can access the data within them. With dynamic arrays, we had to be concerned with moving all of our elements if inserting at a specific place in memory. Another benefit to using a linked list as opposed to using a dynamic array, we don't have to worry about capacity or growing the list.

Here's how to insert into a linked list in a few short steps:
1. Create a new node
2. Set the next node to be the current head
3. set the previous node
