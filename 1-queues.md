# Queues

In this module, you will be introduced to the basic concepts of queues and will be followed with a quick coding challenge.

## What is a queue?
A queue is a linear data structure that represents a list. A queue follows the First in, First Out (FIFO) principle. Deletion (or dequeue) of an element can only take place at the front. Addition of an item will be enqueued at the end of the list. A real life example of a queue would be much like the line to purchase movie tickets at a cinema. The first person in line is the first to be served. We can use queues to process a collection of requests in an orderly fashion. 

## Queue Operations
Queue Operation | What it does  | Code     | Performance
--------------- | ------------- | -------- | -----------
enqueue(value)  | Adds value to the back of queue| new_queue.append()(value)         | 
dequeue()       | value 22 | value 32 |
size()          | value 23 | value 33 |
empty()         |
