# Trees
In this module, you will be introduced to the basic concepts of trees and will be followed with a quick coding challenge.

## What is a tree?
A tree in essence is a linked list. Unlike a linked list, the data is connected in a hierarchical way. Every tree contains a root node, parent nodes and leaf nodes. The tree starts at the top with a root node from which we can access every element of the tree. The parents nodes are those which contain child nodes. Leaf nodes contain no children. The node to the left or right of any parent form a subtree.

## What are the different types of trees?
We are going to cover three different types of trees: binary trees, binary search trees and balanced binary search trees.

### Binary Trees
Binary Trees have a structure in which each node can only have a maximum of two children. We name its children the left and right child. The left child is usually

### Binary Search Trees
The data inserted into a binary search tree is slightly different from a binary tree.
